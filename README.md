## Problem statement

Problem: Google Play Store Analysis + Google Cloud Storage.

Description: Download and Understand the Data (data.zip) and find useful insights from the data.

You can simply do analysis in Google sheet/Excel also. But we prefer that you use Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib/Seaborn librares for analysis and Visualizations.

Task 1: Google Play Store Analysis and create a well documented report in Jupyter notebook.

Task 2: Now, one more task is to upload CSV as dataset in Google BigQuery. After creating dataset on BigQuery with using gogole APIs (Not GUI of BigQuery) in Python code. Save the original CSV file to Google Cloud storage. This uploaded file will work as a backup for our system.

 
[Note: you can use any analysis techniques or methods you want, you should/can use visualization to show the analysis insights. For Analysis Use python If possible]
